- My name is Josh and I'm a PhD student at Colorado State University studying Forest Sciences. 


- I like to call myself a forest landscape ecologist as I'm interested in the processes, dynamics, and functions of forest plants at a landscape scale (think entire forests to entire regions - like the Rockies). 


- I'm really interested in using spatial and statistical tools to understand how plants and plant communities respond to disturbance and what we're doing to conserve and protect forests in a changing world. 

- I'm currently working to understand the effects of climate variability on forest dynamics by leveraging long-term monitoring and tree-ring data.

I call it my profession... but I really just like to play with data to learn new things about nature. I have a few tools I like to use when I "work".
 

 - R Programming
 
 - Google Earth Engine 
  
 - Python

 - ArcGIS 

 - Paper & Pen

## Take a Look Around

I do research, teach, and learn. When I do or find something worthwhile, I want everyone to have access to my data, code, and methodology! When it comes to knowledge, sharing is caring. You can find my projects along with their respective data/code in my repositories.
